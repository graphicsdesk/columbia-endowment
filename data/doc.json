But as the global economy braces for a difficult few years ahead, Columbia will have to face the prospect of significant simultaneous losses within each of these revenue streams, which may not be curtailed by efforts such as a hiring freeze for both academic and administrative positions and re-thinking metrics of tenure eligibility."

At the end of 2019, Moody’s downgraded the outlook for the U.S. higher education sector from “stable” to “negative,”, indicating an expected lag in net tuition revenue. Columbia’s endowment—managed and invested by the Columbia Investment Company and currently valued at almost $11 billion—is a combination of liquid holdings and long term investments. The University only spends the returns on its investments averaged over three fiscal years, a lagging average designed to cushion itstheir assets from quarter to quarter market volatility. In times of crisis, it is at the discretion of University Trustees to alter their endowment spending policy."
